<h2>Stay hungry, Stay foolish</h2>

I like this word. we were taught that to be a good persion, a usefull man to society, but the truth is, whatever you want or not, the society is society, your positive emtions can't light the shadow or they not give a shit to your petty sad. The society is a big business, all you can do to keep you little petty happiness is to be successfull, hungry for your success and less judgment as you just like a fool.
