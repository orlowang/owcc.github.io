**Stay hungry, Stay foolish.** I like this word, we were taught that to be a good persion, a usefull man to society, but the truth is, whatever you want or not, the society is society, your positive emtions can't light the shadow or they not give a shit to your petty sad. The society is a big business, all you can do to keep you little petty happiness is to be successfull, hungry for your success and less judgment as you just like a fool.

### Some warning

- if you have a draft post, just add **draft: true** to its `Front Matter`. but there is a little problem, in the index page there has a news list of limit 5 posts, make sure the date of draft's post name is early than the first 5 posts(you can change to real-day-time when you sure to post), or the news-list will less than 5 posts.
